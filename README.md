# React Component Test Automation with Cypress

The aproach taken to automate this React App, was to use the _component testing_ feacture included with Cypress, insteat of the end-to-end (E2E) testing. This decision was made based on the specificity of the test to be performed, particularly focusing on covering the app's state.

To go deeper enough to get the state, the [_"cypress-react-app-actions"_](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-app-actions) module was implemented. This module allows to easily access the internals of React components.

## Instructions to run test with Cypress

### Preparing the Environment:
1. Clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:ODCenteno/qa-automation-take-home.git`.
2. Install dependencies `npm install`.

### Running Tests:
* To run component test in the command line interface (CLI), use `npm run cy:test`.
* Run test using the browser with `npm run cy:open`. Select 'App.cy.js'.

### Development Dependencies:
* "cypress": "^13.2.0".
* "cypress-react-app-actions": "^1.0.2".

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
